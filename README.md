In the part1 file CNN modelis trained on 3 datasets: cifar10, Fashion MNIST and Linneaus5.

In file part2 Addition and concatenation of CNN layers is performed from the scratch on CIFAR-10 dataset.

The third file is of image segmentation on Oxford-PET dataset and 3 pretrained models : RESNET-50, DENSENET-121, VGG-19 is trained on CIFAR-10 dataset.
